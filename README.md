JavaScript Overview
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It enables developers to create dynamic, interactive websites by responding to user actions like clicks and inputs. JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for web development. It can also be used for server-side development with platforms like Node.js.
